About:
MATLAB codes to the interference function of a given perovskite micro-crystal 

Requirements:
You need to have MATLAB software installed in your system.

Uses:
We have provided the step-by-step procedure in the comment lines of each code. The usage of each available code is summarized below.

 (1) N1, N2, N3: is the complex refractive indices of the media 1,2 and 3 respectively.

 (2) rs and rp: reflection coefficients of s- and p- polarized light, respectively. 

 (3) ts and tp: transmission coefficients of s- and p- polarized light, respectively. 

 (4) IF : Calculates the required interfernce function from the provided refractive indices of the media and the respective reflection and transmission   coefficencts.
